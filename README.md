## 📖 Description

This repository contains the frontend application for **SPEAR**. It provides the user interface for participants and researchers to interact with search-based and chat-based experimental tasks.

Built with **React**, this application communicates with the backend API to manage experiment flows, authentication, task rendering, and data submission.

> **⚠️ Note:** If you want to run the full stack (Frontend + Backend +
> Database) together, please refer to the [Searchat Behavior Parent
> Repository](https://github.com/lapic-ufjf/spear).
> The instructions below are strictly for running the frontend
> **independently** for isolated development or testing.
